# Blank 8HP Eurorack Panel Gerbers
Blank 8HP FR4 Eurorack Panel for use as a filler or with the Europroto2 prototyping board also in my repository.
 
It has copper both sides for strength. Note that the panel has my initials in silkscreen at the bottom - you can just flip it over or make your own with this nifty tool: https://delptronics.com/mcs-panel-maker.php


I have had these panels fabbed by JLCPCB and they came out very nicely. Don't forget to specify the soldermask color you want. Its worth paying the extra $2 to have them remove the order number from the silkscreen - otherwise it will end up on the front side of the panel.
